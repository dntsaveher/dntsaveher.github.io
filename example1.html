  <p>The reason Michael Jordan left the NBA to play baseball. It was 1993 and the Bulls had just won their third straight championship. Michael was mentally exhausted and out of challenges. He felt he had nothing else to prove on the court. His father had tried to get him to retire in 1991 after the first championship, so he could give baseball a shot.
Then out of nowhere in July '93 Michael's father was murdered. His body was found floating in a creek in South Carolina after being shot. His red Lexus (a gift from Mike) with license plate UNC0023 was stripped and found in the woods near Fayetteville, North Carolina.
It was an easy decision for Michael. Retire from the NBA, and make an attempt at baseball to honor his father's wish.
Coincidentally, Jerry Reinsdorf, the owner of the Bulls, also owned the Chicago White Sox. The Birmingham Barons were a Double-A minor league affiliate of the Sox, so Mike made a deal with Reinsdorf to play for the Barons. Michael worked his butt off everyday to get better at baseball. He finished batting .202 with 3 home runs, 51 runs batted in, and 30 stolen bases. 
Fortunately, the MLB went on strike in August 1994. With nothing to do because of the baseball lockout Mike decided to call his friend and former Bulls teammate B.J. Armstrong. They met up at Bakers Square near the Bulls practice facility in Deerfield, IL. After they finished eating, B.J. invited Mike to practice to see his old friends. Phil Jackson let Mike participate in practices for a few weeks and thatâ€™s when the love for the game started to return. Then on March 18, 1995 Jordan sent a two-word fax to the media announcing his return!!!!:
"I'm back."</p>
